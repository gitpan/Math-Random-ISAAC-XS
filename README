NAME
    Math::Random::ISAAC::XS - C implementation of the ISAAC PRNG Algorithm

$Id: README 6749 2009-04-29 23:56:09Z FREQUENCY@cpan.org $

DESCRIPTION
    As with other Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) algorithms like the
    Mersenne Twister (see Math::Random::MT), this algorithm is designed to
    take some seed information and produce seemingly random results as
    output.

    However, ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count) has
    different goals than these commonly used algorithms. In particular, it's
    really fast - on average, it requires only 18.75 machine cycles to
    generate a 32-bit value. This makes it suitable for applications where a
    significant amount of random data needs to be produced quickly, such
    solving using the Monte Carlo method or for games.

    The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased, and unpredictable
    unless you know the seed. The algorithm was published by Bob Jenkins in
    the late 90s and despite the best efforts of many security researchers,
    no feasible attacks have been found to date.

COMPATIBILITY
    This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. Because it
    is C and XS, there may be portability problems, but hopefully these will
    be fixed over the next few releases as CPAN Testers reports come in.

    The author is not a C expert, but has tried to write the module as
    portably as possible. If you encounter any problems on a different version
    or architecture, please contact the maintainer.

CAVEATS
  KNOWN BUGS
    There are no known bugs as of this release.

  LIMITATIONS
    *   There is no method that allows re-seeding of algorithms. This is not
        really necessary because one can simply call "new" again with the
        new seed data periodically.

    *   There was no method supplied to provide the initial seed data. On
        his web site, Bob Jenkins writes:

          Seeding a random number generator is essentially the same problem as
          encrypting the seed with a block cipher.

        But he also provides a simple workaround:

          As ISAAC is intended to be a secure cipher, if you want to reseed
          it, one way is to use some other cipher to seed some initial version
          of ISAAC, then use ISAAC's output as a seed for other instances of
          ISAAC whenever they need to be reseeded.

    *   There is no way to clone a PRNG instance. I'm not sure why this is
        might even be necessary or useful. File a bug report with an
        explanation why and I'll consider adding it to the next release.
